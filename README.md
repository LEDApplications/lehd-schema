# LEHD Schema

This repository contains a restructured version of the lehd schema. The conceptual between this version and previous ones are that generated documentation (html, pdf), binary data files (shapefiles) and schema files are distinct. 

- Schema files and documentation generation are included in the `src`
- Documentation is generated to `gh-pages`
- Binary data files are published on release at [lehd.ces.census.gov](https://lehd.ces.census.gov)


## Instructions

See the [instructions document](./docs/instructions.md#build-the-current-version-of-the-schema) for a step-by-step guide to building the current version of the schema.
